# Prototype-of-online-cart
This is a completed task of a Russian IT company as part of their job-interview. 

The task was:
- to create a prototype of a cart of an online-shop with already added goods;
- to conduct a research of cool current decisions;
- to think over the ideas to increase an online-shop conversion;
- to create design of an online cart, write code of an interactive page using vanilla.js or jQuery (without using CSS-frameworks); 

Special wishes:
- the purchasing process should be in stages (checking the goods, customer data, etc.)

When conducting the task, I used the following instruments:
- html, CSS, jQuery;
- flexbox;
- html variables;
- position: sticky;
etc.
